<p>Formative Labs created social sustainability programs that brought together social web and energy conservation. While there I worked to help design and develop two separate projects, one being a mobile game that allowed users to establish a sustainable lifestyle, and gaining points in the process—which allowed the user to continue to use the game. The second project was a desktop experience for select charities—if the user acquired a sustainable lifestyle (saving energy or recycling) after uploading said proof, the difference in your savings was donated by a VC to the charity of your choice. </p>
