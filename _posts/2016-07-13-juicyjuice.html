<p>Juicy Juice contacted us to help create an interactive mobile interstitial ad, after conception, we worked closely with the client to create the assets that would be used for the experience. I worked directly with the Art Director and in-house design team to create the experience while also making certain we stayed within brand guidelines.</p>
