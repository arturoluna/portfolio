<p>This interactive mobile game was to help promote the Jack Reacher movie before its premiere date. The intended user was to complete the three stages of the game in order to get rewarded, with points that would allow the user to continue to play mobile games. The artwork was pre-established by a third-party agency, I worked closely with the Art Director to ensure we met the clients needs and expectations</p>
