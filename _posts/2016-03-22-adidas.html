<p>A interstitial interactive mobile ad build for Adidas that would animate and inform the user the specific of the productsâ€”the interactive gallery of the product would display specific highlights of the shoe. The design was created in-house, with approval from the client. I worked closely with the Art Director to confirm all feedback was delivered to the clients demands. </p>
