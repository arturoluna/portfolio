<p>Greystripe was contracted to help build the interactive game to promote the product, Pepsi Max. As a team we brainstormed an idea to create a mobile game that included, an accelerometer maze that allowed the user to aquire points to win prizes. I worked closely with a designer and project manager to deliver a seamless experience for this campaign.</p>
