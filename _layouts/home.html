      <p class="lead mt-1 mb-1">
        Currently working on more Front-End roles, I've spent a couple of years working for mobile advertising companies, as a Rich Media Developer. Prior to that, I worked at a start-up for a couple of years, which allowed me to build a foundation in the type of work I am passionate about doing. I enjoy fast paced, long-term projects, that engage and benefit consumers. On my free time I like go eat out with my wife, hang out with my dog, binge watch Netflix, and walk the streets of San Francisco. You can also find me gaming online. </p>
